# pico-vga-332
RP2040 RGB332 scratchpad

Currently just a project to mess about with rgb332 support for https://github.com/bobricius/ VGA picomputer

This is a mess created by combining bits of:
* [PicoVGA](https://github.com/Panda381/PicoVGA)
* [PicoDVI](https://github.com/Wren6991/PicoDVI)
* [MCUME](https://github.com/Jean-MarcHarvengt/MCUME)

If you would like to see good code you should probably refer to the repositories above.
